# Roadmap & remaining TODO

*English | [日本語](./roadmap.ja.md)*

A snapshot of what's built and what's left. For the *why* behind the design,
see [`decisions.md`](./decisions.md).

## Status

| Phase | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Scaffold: Bun workspace, tsconfig, CI, coverage | ✅ done |
| 1 | Signals core: `signal`/`computed`/`effect`, batching, cleanup, ownership | ✅ done |
| 2 | JSX runtime + `render` (fine-grained reactive DOM) | ✅ done |
| 3 | Control flow: `<Show>`, `<For>` (keyed); **TodoMVC runs** | ✅ done |
| 4 | Component model & DX | 🟡 partial — `onMount`, `mergeProps`, `splitProps` done; `context` + scoped CSS open |
| 5 | Bun integration: `create` / `dev` / `build` CLI | ✅ done |
| 6 | Hardening & ecosystem (router, SSR, etc.) | ⬜ not started (optional) |

Quality bar held throughout: **zero runtime dependencies**, `packages/core`
runtime-independent, 100% line/function coverage on all source files, `tsc`
clean, docs bilingual.

## Remaining TODO

### Phase 4 — finish the component model
- [ ] **`context` (`createContext` / `useContext`).** Needs a design decision
  first: in the runtime (no-compiler) model, JSX children are created eagerly,
  so a `<Provider>` can't set a value before its children read it. The
  runtime-only answer is **function children**
  (`<Ctx.Provider value={v}>{() => <App/>}</Ctx.Provider>`), consistent with the
  "functions are lazy" convention already used by `<Show>`. Decide: adopt that
  convention, or pull in a compiler (rejected so far), or keep deferring.
- [ ] **Scoped CSS.** No-compiler options are limited (a runtime `css()` helper
  that hashes a class + injects a `<style>`, vs. a build step). Pick an approach.

### Phase 6 — hardening & ecosystem (optional)
- [ ] **Router** as a separate package (`@kanabun/router`), history-based.
- [ ] **SSR + hydration.** `renderToString` on the server, hydrate on the client.
- [ ] **Stateful HMR** in the dev server (currently full reload — the deliberate
  Phase 5 simplification).
- [ ] **Error boundaries.**
- [ ] **Async / Suspense** primitives (e.g. `resource`).
- [ ] **Dev-time warnings** (e.g. reading a signal you meant to pass as a thunk).

### DX & type precision
- [ ] Tighten `JSX.IntrinsicElements`: it's intentionally permissive (`[name]: any`)
  today; add real per-element attribute and event-handler types.
- [ ] Precise `splitProps` return type (tuple of `Pick`/`Omit`) instead of the
  current loose `Array<Partial<T>>`.

### Tooling & publishing
- [ ] **Publish** `@kanabun/core` and `@kanabun/cli` to npm. Until then, the
  `create`-scaffolded `package.json` references `^0.0.0` placeholders and the
  quickstart runs from this repo.
- [ ] Versioning / release strategy.

### Known minor items (from reviews)
- [ ] Dev server does a `realpath` stat per request for containment, in addition
  to Bun's own resolution (double stat). Fine for a dev server; note only.
- [ ] `parseArgs` treats `--a --b` as `a=true` (no value consumed); acceptable
  for current flags, document if it grows.

## Open design decisions

1. **`context` children model** — function children vs. compiler vs. defer
   (see above). This is the next fork to resolve before Phase 4 is "done".
2. **Scoped CSS strategy** — runtime helper vs. build step.

These mirror the original brief's "hard parts": the signal semantics (Phase 1)
and keyed lists (Phase 3) are solved; stateful HMR (Phase 5/6) was consciously
deferred to full-reload.
